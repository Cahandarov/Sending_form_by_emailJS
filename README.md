Multi-Step Form with Email Sending
This JavaScript code implements a multi-step form with client-side validation and the ability to send form data via email using the Email.js library. This code is designed to be used in a web application where users need to complete a multi-step form and have the form data emailed upon completion.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using this code, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites:

HTML Structure: Create an HTML structure that includes the necessary elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, pages, and buttons. Ensure that the HTML elements match the IDs and classes used in the JavaScript code.

CSS Styles: You should have CSS styles to format and style the form and its elements. Customize the styles according to your design requirements.

Email.js Account: You need an account with Email.js and have your service and template IDs ready. You'll need to initialize the Email.js library with your credentials as shown in the code.

Usage
Include the JavaScript code provided in your web application.

Set up the HTML structure for your multi-step form, ensuring that the element IDs and classes match those used in the code.

Customize the CSS styles to match your design requirements.

Replace the placeholder email service ID and template ID with your actual Email.js service and template IDs.

Test the application to ensure that the multi-step form, validation, and email sending functionality work as expected.

Code Overview

Navigation between form pages.
Client-side validation for each form page.
Sending form data via email using the Email.js library.
